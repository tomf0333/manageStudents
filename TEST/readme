Steps for test:
1. Extract 'TEST'.
2. Open 'Test' directory as a pycharm project.
3. Copy your "manageStudents.c" file into the 'TEST' directory.
4. run test.py
5. if no assert exceptions pop, you are golden! if there are, they will
    specify which input file the problem occurred on and what was YOUR
    program's output. So make sure the corresponding out file is the same
    as that print.
6. good luck!
